The current repository contains the analytical views and models for SalesForce.com data to be used within BigQuery, which enables advanced analysis and reporting. You can find the Entity-Relationship Diagram and more contextual information in the [Data Foundation](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cortex-data-foundation).
