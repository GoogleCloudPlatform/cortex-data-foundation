# This settings file drives how placeholder BQ objects (tables/views/functions) for
# CDC datasets are created.
#
# These are scripts that ensures that necessary dependency tables are created in CDC
# in case they do not exist for whatever reason, so Reporting views do not break.
# This is only executed if _DEPLOY_CDC=true.
