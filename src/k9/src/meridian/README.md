# Cortex for Meridian

One of the key value propositions of Google Cloud Cortex Framework is to provide a Data & AI foundation for next generation enterprise intelligence that enables analytics spanning across key areas such as sales and marketing, order fulfillment and inventory management.

Cortex for Marketing provides cross media platform KPIs and metrics. These metrics are a significant part of the pre-modeling data preparation step for running Googleâ€™s latest Marketing Mix Model (MMM) called [Meridian](https://developers.google.com/meridian). Advertisers can accelerate the pre-modeling data preparation process by leveraging Cortex Data Foundation.

## About Meridian

Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) is a statistical analysis technique that measures the impact of marketing campaigns and activities to guide budget planning decisions and improve overall media effectiveness. MMM uses aggregated data to measure impact across marketing channels and account for non-marketing factors that impact revenue and other key performance indicators (KPIs). MMM is privacy-safe and does not use any cookie or user-level information.
