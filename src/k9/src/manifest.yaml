  # - id: # unique k9 id (required)
  #
  #   path: # k9 path, relative to k9/src directory (required)
  #
  #   entry_point: bash or python file, path relative to relative to k9/src directory,
  #       The script should accept 2 parameters - config.json path and logs bucket name.
  #       Current directory will be Data Foundation repo root.
  #       If no entry_point specified:
  #           1. All files will be processed with jinja.
  #           2. All sql files will be executed in alphabetical order.
  #           3. All files will be recursively copied to the target DAGs bucket "dag/{id}" folder.
  #             (id is k9s id)
  #         !!! "reporting" subfolder will be excluded !!!
  #
  #   test_data: # name(s) of test data table(s), multiple names must be comma-separated.
  #
  #   test_data_target: test data target dataset as dot-separated path to the config variable,
  #       examples:
  #       - k9.datasets.processing (default) - k9 processing dataset
  #       - SAP.datasets.cdc - SAP CDC dataset
  #       - SAP.datasets.reporting - SAP Reporting dataset
  #       If last component is "reporting", then copying to the target project, otherwise - the source one.
  #
  #   stage: pre or post, whether to deploy this k9 before (pre) or after (post) all workloads.
  #
  #   workload_dependencies: (only if stage is "post") workloads that must be deployed with this k9,
  #                          separated with comma:
  #                           SAP, SFDC, marketing, CM360, GoogleAds, TikTok, LiveRamp, Meta, SFMC, GA4.
  #                          If one or more of listed workloads are not deployed,
  #                           this k9 will be skipped.
  #
  #   reporting_settings: reporting setting yaml file, path relative to `path` above.
  #       if specified, "reporting" directory should exist in directory specified by `path`.
  #       SQL files in that directory will be executed and deployed with the materializer using the reporting
  #       setting file.
