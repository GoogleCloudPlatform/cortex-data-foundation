/* Sample script for keywords reporting directly from Keywords tables.

This is a sample script showing how to directly use the Keywords table that contain pre-aggregated
measures as reported by Google Adwords reporting API.

Some of the measures are non-additive and hence should not be aggregated directly further.
Instead such fields should be aggregated and calculated by using the underlying core additive
measures.

All cost metrics are presented in customer currency.
